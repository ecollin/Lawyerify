    <p> Lawyerify's purpose is to make sentences as long and pretentious sounding as possible. It works, basically, 
    by looking up each word typed in a thesaurus and replacing it with its synonym that has the most characters. 
    This is supposed to result in the longest text possible with a close meaning. I made it for fun and as a learning exercise
    in web development. </p>
    <p>I must admit that it doesn't achieve it's purpose exceedingly well. The main problem is that when words are lawyerified
    the synonyms often end up not being close enough in meaning to the original words and the lawyerified text either is nonsensical
    or has a different meaning. A big problem in the development of an ideal lawyerify website is finding a good thesaurus. 
    I didn't find a single good thesaurus that was free and easily usable in web design (I couldn't find a good free thesaurus API,
    for those who know what that means. The search was made harder because I wanted a HTTPS API). For example, in the thesaurus I ended
    up using, the word "a" is synonymous with "letter of the alphabet" and "he" is synonymous with "Helium." To be fair, 
    had I been willing to pay for a thesaurus, webscrape (get) my information from a decent thesaurus like google or thesaurus.com
    (to do so would've required much research and been slower), or implement a system where I could find the best synonyms for 
    the most frequently used 1000 words or so and not require a bad thesaurus for those, lawyerify would be better. 
    Despite the shortfalling listed, in addition to the fact that because I refused to pay for a thesaurus it can only look up
    a certain number of words a day (PLEASE do not try to find out what happens when the limit is exceeded by exceeding the limit. 
    It will simply create a pop-up alerting the user that the site won't work anymore and the original text will be shown
    when lawyerify is clicked.), I think lawyerify works pretty well for what it is. Some sentences are translated quite poorly,
    but others work well and are amusing. It changes "Life is filled with exuberant people and bored people" to 
    "Organic phenomenon is occupied with high-spirited people and world-weary people." I'm content with it.

    <p id="caption">I thought having these photos of attractive people here might make the site more visited.
    They're mostly unrelated, although, the web designer has been told he looks a lot like the photos on top. </p>
